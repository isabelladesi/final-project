                    <p>Hi! I'm Isabella De Sousa. I am a Computer Sceince major at the University of Michigan- Ann Arbor, currently based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
                        My academic journey is punctuated by rigorous coursework, including Data Structures and Algorithms and Discrete Mathematics, which has fortified my 
                        foundation in critical technical domains. Throughout my academic and professional endeavors, I've cultivated a robust toolkit of technical skills, 
                        underpinned by hands-on projects that range from developing machine learning algorithms to creating interactive virtual reality applications
                        My co-founding role at Pura Life Mas Vida Foundation and leadership in the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers exemplify my commitment to 
                        community and professional excellence.
                    </p>
